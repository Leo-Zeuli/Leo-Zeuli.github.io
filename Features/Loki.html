      While the character arcs are forced in the most Disney way, Loki manages to twist a predictable plot to mild results.

    <p class="general">
      Disney these days has a few reliable messages: stay true to yourself, don't be evil, and coming together is what the cool kids these days are doing. Marvel has done an OK job in the past of straying away from these themes - don't be evil is all over, but a lot of times that's mixed in with another context. Iron Man is about not being evil in terms of greed. Black Panther added a lot of moral ambiguity to that message. Civil War distorted what good and evil meant by pitting superheroes against each other. Nonetheless, with the exception of the Avengers movies, coming together was not a big part of the MCU's messaging as much as don't be evil was. Loki; however, is bringing the message to the forefront; however, it chooses to apply that message to a character(s) that almost exclusively works alone. Instead of dealing with how people come together, it first deals with getting everyone on the good side. It's difficult to write and the writing of Loki very much makes the character arcs feel forced to satisfy a larger messaging. I called that Mobius would turn sides way before he did (and mark my words he's coming back in the next episode). Once you become saturated with enough Disney, you know where the message of the story is going and can figure out character arcs from there. It just feels too forced of a character arc especially when you consider some of the ways the show forces people to talk; Loki upsetting Sylvia's master plan was just a way to get them to talk and come together. Don't really believe Loki could have upset a plan that easily; and Sylvia makes very limited efforts to stand in his way. In conclusion, Disney needs to find a new message because it's plaguing their shows; Loki will end with everyone coming together to mark my words (Edit: this is what happened, as I predicted).

      On the suggestion of plot however, I very much like the shift to the enemy being an institution rather than a singular person; it will probably turn out to be a single person in the end, but it's nice right now when it's not (Edit: also what happened; it's pretty hard to write something in the MCU without an explicit villain so Iâ€™ll give them a pass here).

      The editing in Loki though ever so slightly baffles me. The final fight scene of episode 4 starts with very quick cuts between multiple wide shots (and by multiple I mean like 6 or 7) and then cuts to the Time Keepers for longer than it held on any of the wide shots. It's unclear what the focus is on in this scene; the fighting's editing is jumbled and just random and the inclusion of the Time Keepers is just distracting. However the shots of the Time Keepers a sick; they have some smoke spreading away from them when they are in singles and this is one of the few Marvel productions that uses the visual effects outside of fight scenes to add atmosphere and and just a general appreciation for the world building (I can't put my finger on why it's such a nice addition to use visual effects when they are not needed, but they're very appreciated). Back to the point; the editing issues underscore a broader issue of poorly done fight scenes; the majority of MCU fight scenes add a little camera shake, have a couple fights to edit between, and cut frequently. These are not bad moves, but they're bland when it's all the MCU does. The fight at the end of episode 4 is an exception to this formulaic bad fight, but a bad exception.

      What ties Loki all together is the plot twists and they're packing them in. Ohh, and also Owen Wilson because he feels more like a protagonist than Loki at this point. What with him having the least forced character arc and the non-stop power that is the voice behind Lightning McQueen.
