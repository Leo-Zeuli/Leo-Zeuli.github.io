      <p class="general">When I initially drew this piece, I was keen to make it perfect (straight lines, proportional features, consistent spacing, etc.). But when I transferred it to an SVG, I was unconcerned with a perfect form. Instead, I focused on preserving the piece as it was drawn (i.e. keeping its imperfections).</p><p class="general">I prefer the original piece over the updated SVG, but only when the two are compared next to each other. When they’re separated, I prefer the updated version. It’s an odd phenomenon where I prefer imperfections in art only when its compared to other art. But odd feelings like this are what make us human.</p><p class="general">Below is the updated SVG and a scan of the original.</p>
