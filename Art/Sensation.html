    <p class="general">Sensation comes in lot of ways; hopefully this sparks as many as it can through a screen. A reduction to two colors (ignoring black and white) creates a touchable texture. Squares resembling environments, fire, and water bring the sensation of smell. Lines evocative of morse code bring a hint of hearing. And hopefully after reading this blurb you can taste the nonsense of my description; it looks cool and has interesting graphic design â€“ that enough to sensate the brain.</p>
